Complex objects
===============

Normally we would define vertices, polygons and normals manually. However, it is easier (and often better) to use a 3D modelling program to generate the data and then import it as a text file which we will need to parse.

We can also generate objects procedurally, such as:

- Objects based on quadratic equations
- Fractals
- Terrain-generation algorithms
- Noise functions
- Particles animations
